# credit-risk-classification



## Overview 

Purpose:
The purpose of this analysis is to develop a machine learning algorithm to classify credit risk as either a healthy or high-risk loan.This helps companies in assessing the creditworthiness of applicants.

Features: loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt-to-income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory marks, and total debt. 
Target: loan_status.


 * Dataset: 77,536
 * Train Data:58,152
 * Test Data:19,384



Steps:(LR model)

Load data into a dataframe.

Create loan_status as labels and use the other columns as features.

Split the data into training and test datasets.

Fit a logistic regression model using the training data.

Save the predictions on the testing data labels by using the testing feature data and the fitted model.

Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance by generating a confusion matrix and printing the classification report.




## Results
logistic regression Model,Accuracy Score:0.99


## Healthy Loan (0) :
* Precision: 1.00
* Recall: 0.99
* F1:1.00


## High-Risk Loan (1):
* Precision: 0.84
 * Recall: 0.94
 * F1:0.89


## Summary

I recommend  Logistic Regression model  because of its higher accuracy, precision,  recall  and  F1 score values for both healthy and high-risk loans .
The performance of the model depends on the specific problem we are trying to solve. In this case, achieving high precision and recall values for high-risk loans is more significant than for healthy loans.
